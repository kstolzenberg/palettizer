#Introduction
Palettizer is an iterative set of tools for designing with color.  Palettizer_random generates six numerically-random colors using either RGB or HSL color models.  Palettizer_related produces a balanced palette around two saturated complementary colors and their light/dark/desaturated accents.  Palettizer_render applies a particular palette to a perspective drawing to study color plane assignment.  Notes and process can be found on [tumblr](http://palettizer.tumblr.com/)

Palettizer was originally developed to improve efficiency in color palette selection for interior architecture, where a palette is typically built around one to two defining colors and several accents.
